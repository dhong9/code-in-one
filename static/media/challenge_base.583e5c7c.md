### Single-Function (Codewriting)

Implement the function in your preferred language. When run, your function is wrapped in a closure, so some declarations may result in a Syntax (Compilation) Error.

Keep the following details in mind:
* Do not change the name of the function/method. Changing its name will result in a syntax error.
* You can write to stdout for debugging purposes; output will be displayed under each test case.
* If the value of some input/output argument is a string that contains double quote characters (") it will be shown in the output with an additional symbol. E.g. `inputString = hello"world"hello` will be displayed in the console as `"hello"world"hello"`.
